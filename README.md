Small Satellite Constellation Separation

This project 1) Replicates the linear-programming-based optimization done
by Sin et al. and 2) modifies the optimization problem to include nonlinear
constraints with the goal of evaluating the performance and computational
complexity of the two optimization methods.

To run this program, execute the SmallSatOptimiation.m file in MATLAB.
